                        "One form liquefies into a glistening puddle, another reproduces in a vibrant entanglement, while a third convulses under the invasive force of a parasitic entity. Symbionts traces an organic cycle of interaction within an unfamiliar ecosystem. It reveals the radiant elegance and the unrelenting violence inherent in the symbiotic relationships between diverse and peculiar life forms.\n\nThe film employs a distinctive visual language by merging digital 3D animation with a custom-developed texturing tool. This approach introduces a sense of abstraction while maintaining a tactile, almost recognizable reality, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in a world that is simultaneously alien and intimately biological.",
